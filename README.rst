pymop - Multi-Objective Optimization Problems
==================================

This framework provides a collection of test problems in Python. The main features are:

- Most important multi-objective test function is one place
- Vectorized evaluation by using numpy matrices
- Easily new problems can be created using custom classes or functions

Here, you can find a detailed documentation and information about the framework:
